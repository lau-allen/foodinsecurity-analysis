# Analyzing Food Insecurity in NYC using KeyFoods Price Catalogs

The goal of this notebook is to study the food insecurity problem by looking at the listed prices of various food items across neighborhoods in NYC. Our hypothesis is that *people living in areas with higher food insecurity problems would pay more for the same items compared to those in more secured areas*. For the scope of work, we will only assess food products from KeyFoods supermarkets, one of the top 4 Supermarket Leaders in Metro New York (according [Food Trade News 2021 report](https://www.foodtradenews.com/2021/06/29/food-trade-news-2021-market-study-issue/)). 

This analysis will be done using Apache Spark and Google Colab / Google Cloud Dataproc.
